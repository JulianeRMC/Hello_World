# Hello_World
Hi world My name is Juliane Rocha and I´m from Brazil.Lately I´m in college coursing Mechatronics engeneering and my goal is to work with bionic prosthetics.The repositories that I´m going to create here in this platform will be related iniciality to the activities at my couse, but when I get better at coding I´ll probably post somethings related to arduino and bionic prosthetics
